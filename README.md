## Introduction

House price prediction is a crucial area of real estate and economic studies, allowing buyers, sellers, and investors to make informed decisions. This project implements different machine learning techniques to forecast house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant attributes.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for visualization and exploration)

## Dataset

This project utilizes a dataset that includes various features describing houses sold in a specific area. The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column Name          | Description                                             | Type                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `price`              | The sale price of the property                          | Numerical              |
| `area`               | Total area of the house (in square feet)               | Numerical              |
| `bedrooms`           | Number of bedrooms                                      | Numerical              |
| `bathrooms`          | Number of bathrooms                                     | Numerical              |
| `stories`            | Number of stories in the house                          | Numerical              |
| `parking`            | Number of parking spaces available                      | Numerical              |
| `mainroad`           | Whether the property is located on a main road (Yes/No)| Categorical (Yes/No)   |
| `guestroom`          | Whether the property has a guest room (Yes/No)         | Categorical (Yes/No)   |
| `basement`           | Whether the property has a basement (Yes/No)           | Categorical (Yes/No)   |
| `hotwaterheating`    | Whether the property has hot water heating (Yes/No)     | Categorical (Yes/No)   |
| `airconditioning`    | Whether the property has air conditioning (Yes/No)      | Categorical (Yes/No)   |
| `prefarea`           | Whether the property is in a preferred area (Yes/No)   | Categorical (Yes/No)   |
| `furnishingstatus`   | Status of furnishing (Furnished/Semi-furnished/Unfurnished)| Categorical (F/S/U)    |
